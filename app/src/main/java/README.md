This app is meant to be used as a social networking app for recent college graduates. 
Once a user signs in, they are brought to the main app which offers three different tabs: Map, Messages, and Settings. 
On the map tab, you can see all users' last known locations (red markers) and their work locations (green markers).
The point of this Map is that the current user can find other graduates in places unknown to them.
Some users may need to find roommates in the city they are going to be working in.
If so, they have the option to see if other users are working in the same location and can subsequently send them a message to coordinate living situations.
Other times, users may just be visiting a location, in which case they can send out messages to other users to meet up.
The Messages tab holds all the chat groups the user participates in. Users can create private or group chats. 
Lastly, the Settings tab allows users to update their work location and also gives them a chance to write a bio. 
If a user writes a bio, other users will be able to see your bio on your markers on the map.

NOTE: When you first launch the app, you may have to wait a little before the Map can get your location. 
It is slow.
